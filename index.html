            <pre>
                Our tale begins with the heaviest storm
                The Fools beached on our shore
                They wake beneath the Great Lighthouse of yore
                Built thousands of years before
            </pre>
            <pre>
                I set them to sea, to see how they fair
                Stormstrider lighting the way
                With only each other to stand by their sides
                They kept foes at bay, at least for today
            </pre>
            <pre>
                With danger approaching, they tried and they tried
                The Aquapocalypse ever raging topside
                More relics of sirens they pull from the depths
                Unaware that their quest might lead them to their deaths
            </pre>
            <pre>
                Our tale began with the heaviest storm
                Now I'm afraid how it ends
                Believe me, believe me, I've seen it before
                The darkness that lurks in the eye of the storm
                The darkness that lurks in
                The darkness that lurks in the eye
            </pre>
            <pre>
                I guess we'll find out who's the greatest of Fools
            </pre>
